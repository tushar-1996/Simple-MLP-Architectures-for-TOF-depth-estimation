# Simple MLP Architectures for TOF depth estimation

## Summary
- Investigated performance of simple MLP architectures like gMLP, ResMLP, and MLP Mixer for TOF depth estimation from raw correlation measurements.
- Transformed sequence-to-sequence networks (simple MLP architecture) to an image-to-image network.
- Achieved comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art transformer models, with 30% fewer parameters.

Code Coming Soon....
